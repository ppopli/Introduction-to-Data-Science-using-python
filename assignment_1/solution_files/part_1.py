# Solution to Part 1 of the assignment.

# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals,
# # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals

# creating and shapping data set to be used for answering question.

# reading csv file, setting index to column 0 , skipping first row.

Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?'''

''' Question 2:
Which country had the biggest difference between their summer
and winter gold medal counts? '''

def answer_two():

''' Question 3:
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal
counts relative to their total gold medal count? '''

''' Question 4:
Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value
where each gold medal (Gold.2) counts for 3 points, silver medals (Silver.2) for
2 points, and bronze medals (Bronze.2) for 1 point.The function should return
only the column (a Series object) which you created. '''
