# Introduction-to-Data-Science-using-python

Applied data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python packages pandas and numpy. Applied numpy and panadas techniques to manipulate and clean data in three assignments with different complexities. The three assignments are as follows:-

* **Assignment 1: - ** In Part 1, Worked with olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. Based on this data set answered some questions. In Part 2, worked with census data (census.csv) from [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html) and answered some question based on it.

* **Assignment 2: - ** In this assignment worked with three different data set to learn and understand merging, grouping and variours other features of pandas packages. The three data sources were,  [energy supply and renewable electricity production](Energy%20Indicators.xls) from the [United Nations](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/excel_file_tables/2013/Energy%20Indicators.xls), GDP data from the file `world_bank.csv`, which is a csv containing countries' GDP from 1960 to 2015 from [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) and [Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?category=2102) from the file `scimagojr-3.xlsx`, which ranks countries based on their journal contributions in the aforementioned area.

* **Assignment 3: - ** In this assignment, work with data from different sources like excel file, csv file and text file. Also, worked on hypothesis using the data as follows : -
	**Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions.
	
	**The following data files are available for this assignment:**
	* From the [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for [all homes at a city level](http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/City/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv), ```City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv```, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
	* From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) which has been copy and pasted into the file ```university_towns.txt```.
	* From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file ```gdplev.xls```.
